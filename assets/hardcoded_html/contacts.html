                <strong>Brief bio:</strong> Was born in Simferopol in 1984. After primary school went to Simferopol
                Hauler Technical school where I studied logistic and management of motor transport. It was late 90s
                when
                computers and programming classes started appear in our town. I didn’t have my own computer, but I
                was
                passionate about them so I took classes on MSDOS, Windows 95 and the programs which were available
                at
                the time. After I mastered MSDOS and Norton Commander we started to learn programming with Turbo
                Pascal
                and Delphi. There was start in my programming life. After technical school I matriculated to Taurida
                National University where I studied psychology, psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. I didn’t became
                psychotherapist though it was a very great time and experience. After fourth university year I
                started
                working as flash developer in Arkadium inc., simferopol’s office. I did casual games reskins and
                developed new games from scratch. After Arkadium I did flash programming for America gmbh. Later I
                became freelancer. As a freelancer I used java and php languages. A year ago I started to learn
                python
                and django framework. I love python for it’s pithiness.
